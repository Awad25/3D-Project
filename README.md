# 3D-Project
An interactive and immersive AI-powered language learning application built with React Three Fiber (R3F) and OpenAI. This project leverages 3D graphics and artificial intelligence to create a modern, engaging language teaching experience.

Features
🧠 AI Integration: Uses the OpenAI API to provide real-time language assistance and interaction.
🌐 3D Environment: Built with React Three Fiber for an immersive 3D experience.
📖 Language Learning: Focuses on providing personalized and effective language teaching.
💡 Interactive Design: Dynamic UI and UX for a seamless user experience.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js (v16 or later)
npm or yarn
OpenAI API key
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
